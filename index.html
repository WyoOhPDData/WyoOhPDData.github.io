  <h1>WYOMING OHIO POLICE DATA REPOSITORY</h1>

  <p style=" margin:30px">Thank you for visiting! I have uploaded all the public documents I have on the Wyoming
  Police Department to this website. Desktop users should be able to scroll through
  the PDFs without downloading them. Mobile users cannot and will need to use
  the DOWNLOAD link for each one. I am working to fix this.</p>
  <p>If you have any other data you want to add, let me know I will
  upload it. Thanks!</p>

  <h2>NEW: 2019 Citation Demographics</h2>
  <h3><a href="Files/Traffic Stop Review 2019.pdf">DOWNLOAD PDF</a></h3>
  <p style="margin: 30px 400px 0px 40px"> It should surprise no one from Wyoming that the majority of people pulled  over, cited, and fined 
  are Black people that do not live in Wyoming. Mr. Ballinger attempts to justify this by pointing out the
  racial makeup of neighborhood areas, but his 52.2% number for Black drivers is wrong because he did not 
  use a weighted average. 52.2% is what you get by averaging the percentages shown in the table, but it does
  not take into account the populations. Lincoln Heights is 87% Black, but only has about 3,000 residents. 
  Springfield Township on the other hand has over 36,000. My weighted average predicts that 43% of drivers 
  should be Black. Mr. Ballinger also fails to take into account Wyoming's 14% black population when 
  calculating the average incorrectly. Ironically, including 14% in the incorrect calculation gives a result
  of 45% which is similar to the weighted average; this is coincidental.</p>
